VoigtFit
=========

VoigtFit is written to make absorption line fitting a *breeze*.
Dig in, and you will be constraining the contents of metals in remote galaxies before you know it!



Development of VoigtFit happens `on GitHub
<https://github.com/jkrogager/VoigtFit>`_ so if you encounter any issues or you have
ideas for great new features, you can `raise an issue on the GitHub page
<https://github.com/jkrogager/VoigtFit/issues>`_.
