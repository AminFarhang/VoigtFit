Some motivation


Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Python version 2.7 (Python 3 is not supported yet)

VoigtFit depends on ``matplotlib``, ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``h5py``, ``astropy``, and ``lmfit``. You
can install these using your favorite Python package manager and I would
recommend [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) if you don't already have
an opinion.

Using pip
---------

The easiest way to install the most recent stable version of ``VoigtFit`` is
with [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/):

    pip install VoigtFit


From source
-----------

Alternatively, you can get the source by cloning the git
repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jkrogager/VoigtFit.git

Once you've downloaded the source, you can navigate into the root source
directory and run:

    python setup.py install
